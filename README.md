# Chalk ðŸ“‹âž•
## Simple LL Recursive Descent Parser Interpreted Calculator :)

`chalk` is my first true dive into creating an interpreter, and as such is a simple starting point. While doing my Discrete Math homework this semester, I've wanted a quick calculator I can pull up to evaluate quick expressions in my terminal and had been running Python's REPL beforehand. As such, I decided to cook up this tiny project as an alternative. 

Chalk includes the `chalk-core` crate that handles tokenization and parsing, alongside `chalk` which is a CLI tool with two modes of execution:

1. Running chalk with an immediate expression, such as `chalk 1 + 1` will evaluate the expression and exit, printing it to standard out

2. If no immediate expression is provided, `chalk` enters REPL mode and will evaluate expressions until the program is exited

```bash
Welcome to the Chalk Repl

--> 1 + 1
2
--> lcm(5!, 12!)
479001600
--> gcd((2^3)!, 17^8)
128
--> floor(1-1/1000)
0
--> 
```

`chalk` currently has support for:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- Exponentiation
- Operator precedence
- Parenthesis and Absolute value bars 
- Unary negation
- Factorial!
- `gcd` and `lcm`
- `floor` and `ceil`
- Trig functions `sin`, `cos` and `tan`, and their inverses `asin`, `acos` and `atan`
- Extremely simple runtime types system
    - Different operations including `factorial`, `floor`, `ceil`, etc require integers only (and in some cases unsigned only)
    - Enum based type system allows for these assertions and lossless coercions if possible
    - Next steps now that this system's in place is to add boolean operations >:)

If there are any other operations or features you'd like to see, please feel free to make a Pull Request or create an issue :)
